Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Silicon Labs Si7034 chips.

The Si7034 is a digital relative humidity and temperature sensor
integrating humidity and temperature sensor elements along with an
analog-to-digital converter, signal processing, calibration data and a
digital I2C interface. The humidity and temperature sensors on each unit
are factory calibrated ensuring that the devices are fully
interchangeable with no recalibration or software changes required.

The Si7034 is packaged in a 2x2 mm QFN package, are reflow solderable
and offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal
for measuring humidity, temperature and dew-point in applications
ranging from HVAC/R and asset tracking to industrial and consumer
platforms.
