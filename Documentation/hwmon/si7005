Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Silicon Labs Si7005 and Si7015 chips.

The Si7005 and Si7015 are digital relative humidity and temperature sensors
integrating humidity and temperature sensor elements along with an
analog-to-digital converter, signal processing, calibration data and a
digital I2C interface. The humidity and temperature sensors on each unit
are factory calibrated ensuring that the devices are fully
interchangeable with no recalibration or software changes required.

The Si7005 and Si7015 are packaged in 4x4 mm QFN packages, are reflow solderable
and offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal
for measuring humidity, temperature and dew-point in applications
ranging from HVAC/R and asset tracking to industrial and consumer
platforms.
